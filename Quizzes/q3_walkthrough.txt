Looking at this MAT 320 Quiz 3 on digital filters, I'll walk you through each question step by step.

## Questions 1-6: Filter F1 Analysis

The filter is defined as: **yt = xt - (1/4)yt-1**

### Question 1: Transfer Function H(z)
To find H(z), I'll take the Z-transform:
- Starting with: yt + (1/4)yt-1 = xt
- Z-transform gives: Y(z) + (1/4)z⁻¹Y(z) = X(z)
- Factor out Y(z): Y(z)[1 + (1/4)z⁻¹] = X(z)
- Therefore: H(z) = Y(z)/X(z) = 1/[1 + (1/4)z⁻¹]
- Multiply top and bottom by z: **H(z) = z/(z + 1/4)**

**Answer: b) z/(z + 1/4)**

### Question 2: Pole Location
The pole occurs when the denominator equals zero:
- z + 1/4 = 0
- z = -1/4

**Answer: a) -1/4**

### Question 3: Frequency Response at ω = 0
H(ω) = H(e^(iω)). At ω = 0:
- H(0) = H(1) = 1/(1 + 1/4) = 1/(5/4) = 4/5

**Answer: b) 4/5**

### Question 4: Magnitude Response at ω = π/2
At ω = π/2, e^(iπ/2) = i:
- H(i) = i/(i + 1/4)
- |H(i)| = |i|/|i + 1/4| = 1/√((1/4)² + 1²)
- = 1/√(1/16 + 1) = 1/√(17/16) = √(16/17)

**Answer: e) √(16/17)**

### Question 5: Frequency with Smallest Response
The magnitude |H(e^(iω))| = 1/|e^(iω) + 1/4| is minimized when |e^(iω) + 1/4| is maximized. This represents the distance from the point -1/4 to points on the unit circle. Through geometric analysis or calculation, this maximum distance occurs at ω = π/3.

**Answer: c) π/3**

### Question 6: Unit Impulse Response y₂
With input x = (1, 0, 0, 0, ...) and zero initial conditions:
- y₀ = 1 - (1/4)(0) = 1
- y₁ = 0 - (1/4)(1) = -1/4
- y₂ = 0 - (1/4)(-1/4) = 1/16

**Answer: e) 1/16**

## Questions 7-10: Reson Filter Analysis

The reson filter has poles at **Re^(±iθ)** with **θ = π/4** and **R = 1-ε** (ε small).

### Question 7: Output y₂ for Unit Impulse
For a reson filter, the difference equation is:
yt = xt + 2Rcos(θ)yt-1 - R²yt-2

With θ = π/4, cos(θ) = √2/2:
- y₀ = 1
- y₁ = 0 + √2R(1) - 0 = √2R
- y₂ = 0 + √2R(√2R) - R²(1) = 2R² - R² = R²

**Answer: e) R²**

### Question 8: Half-Power Bandwidth
For a reson filter with R = 1-ε close to 1, the approximate half-power bandwidth is:
B ≈ 2(1-R) = 2ε

**Answer: d) 2ε**

### Question 9: Maximum Magnitude Response
For a normalized reson filter with poles at Re^(±iθ), the maximum magnitude response (before normalization) is approximately:
|H(ω)|max ≈ 1/[(1-R²)sin(θ)]

With θ = π/4, sin(θ) = √2/2:
|H(ω)|max = √2/(1-R²)

**Answer: b) √2/(1-R²)**

### Question 10: Cosine of ωm
The frequency ωm where the magnitude response peaks satisfies:
cos(ωm) = (1+R²)/(2R) × cos(θ)

With cos(θ) = √2/2:
cos(ωm) = (1+R²)/(2√2R)

**Answer: c) (1+R²)/(2√2R)**

These problems test understanding of digital filter analysis, including transfer functions, pole-zero analysis, frequency response, and the special properties of reson filters used for narrow-band filtering.
