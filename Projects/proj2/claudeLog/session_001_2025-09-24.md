# Claude Code Session Log - MAT 320 Project 2

**Session:** 001  
**Date:** September 24, 2025  
**Project:** DFT and FFT Implementation  
**Author:** Nixx Varboncoeur  
**Claude Model:** Sonnet 4  

## Session Overview

Initial project setup and structure review for MAT 320 Project 2: DFT and FFT Implementation.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- **Created standard genStandards-compliant directory hierarchy:**
  - `src/` - Source code files
  - `include/` - Header files (currently empty)
  - `bin/` - Compiled executables (empty, ready for build)
  - `obj/` - Object files (empty, ready for build)
  - `input/` - Test input files (populated)
  - `output/` - Expected output files (populated)
  - `tests/` - Test suites (empty)
  - `docs/` - Documentation (empty)
  - `claudeLog/` - AI collaboration session logs

- **Removed unnecessary directories** not specified in README hierarchy:
  - `lib/`, `data/`, `deps/`, `build/`, `scripts/`

### 2. Build System Updates
- **Updated Makefile** for separate executable architecture:
  - Changed from single `dft_fft` target to separate `dft1` and `fft1` targets
  - Added `both` target to build both programs
  - Individual program build targets: `make dft1`, `make fft1`
  - Updated linking patterns for separate executables
  - Enhanced test targets: `test-dft`, `test-fft`, `test-both`
  - Improved help system with program-specific usage examples
  - Updated clean targets to handle both executables

### 3. Documentation
- **Updated README.txt** with proper project structure:
  - Formatted assignment specifications from original text
  - Added implementation requirements and guidelines
  - Included build instructions and testing framework
  - Added AI disclosure section

## Current Code State

### Files Present:
1. **`src/dft1.h`** - DFT class definition (545 bytes)
   - Complex number typedef definitions
   - DFT class with constructor, Read(), Execute(), Print() methods
   - Uses std::vector<std::complex<double>> for data storage

2. **`src/dft1.cpp`** - DFT implementation (720 bytes)
   - Read() method implemented for complex number file parsing
   - Execute() and Print() methods are empty stubs
   - Handles complex number format: "real+imagi" or "real-imagi"

3. **`src/fft1.h`** - FFT header (24 bytes)
   - Nearly empty, only contains commented include

4. **`src/fft1.cpp`** - FFT implementation (17 bytes)
   - Only contains include statement, no implementation

5. **`src/main.cpp`** - Main program (485 bytes)
   - Command-line argument handling for DFT program
   - Creates DFT object and calls methods
   - Note: This main.cpp is specifically for the DFT implementation

### Test Data:
1. **`input/Input01.txt`** - First test case (8 complex numbers)
2. **`input/Input02.txt`** - Second test case (8 complex numbers)  
3. **`output/Output01.txt`** - Expected results for test case 1
4. **`output/Output02.txt`** - Expected results for test case 2
5. **`dftoutput.txt`** - Original assignment sample data

## Technical Assessment

### Current Implementation Status:
- **DFT Program**: Partially implemented with class-based approach
  - ✅ File reading functionality working
  - ❌ DFT algorithm not implemented (Execute() method empty)
  - ❌ Output formatting not implemented (Print() method empty)
  - ⚠️ Uses class structure with separate main.cpp

- **FFT Implementation**: Not started
  - ❌ No implementation present
  - ❌ No recursive algorithm implementation

### Code Architecture Notes:
- **Current Approach**: Class-based with separate main.cpp
- **Assignment Requirement**: Two standalone programs (dft1.cpp and fft1.cpp)
- **Current main.cpp**: Configured for DFT testing (as noted in comments)

### Build System Improvements Made:
- ✅ **Separate executable targets**: `dft1` and `fft1` 
- ✅ **Individual testing**: `test-dft` and `test-fft` targets
- ✅ **Proper dependency management**: Each program builds independently
- ✅ **Enhanced help system**: Program-specific usage examples

## Assignment Requirements Analysis

### Per Assignment Specs:
- **Two separate programs required**: `dft1.cpp` and `fft1.cpp`
- **Identical command-line interface**: Both should take same arguments
- **Identical output**: Must produce same results for same inputs
- **FFT Constraint**: N must be power of 2 (2^m)
- **No external dependencies**: Compile with g++ only, no additional headers/libraries

### Current vs. Required Structure:
- ⚠️ **Current**: Class-based approach with separate main.cpp (acceptable architecture)
- ✅ **Build System**: Updated to handle separate executables correctly
- ❌ **FFT Implementation**: Not yet started
- ❌ **Algorithm Implementation**: DFT Execute() method still empty

## Next Steps Recommended

### Immediate Priority:
1. **Implement DFT algorithm**:
   - Complete the Execute() method in DFT class
   - Formula (2.6) from textbook page 152
   - Implement Print() method with proper formatting

2. **Create FFT implementation**:
   - Design class structure for FFT (similar to DFT)
   - Recursive approach per Formula (6.9) from textbook page 163
   - Handle N = 2^m constraint
   - Ensure identical interface to DFT program

3. **Testing and validation**:
   - Use updated Makefile test targets
   - Verify identical outputs between DFT and FFT
   - Validate against provided sample data

### Build System Status:
- ✅ **Updated for separate executables**: Ready for implementation
- ✅ **Individual and combined testing**: Test targets configured
- ✅ **Proper dependency handling**: Each program builds independently

## Session Notes

This session focused on establishing proper project foundation and updating the build system to handle the assignment requirement for separate executable programs. The current class-based architecture is acceptable and the main.cpp is correctly configured for DFT implementation (as noted in the code comments).

The test data is properly organized and the Makefile has been enhanced to support the dual-program architecture with individual testing capabilities.

**Session Status:** ✅ Complete - Project structure established, build system updated for separate executables, ready for algorithm implementation phase.
